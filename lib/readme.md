# Lib Folder
In many applications, you'll find a lib folder. These are usually
libraries that have come from somewhere else and you shoud not
edit them.

In this case, I've included two files.
 * `getEvents.js` adds `getEvents()` to window. (e.g.: `window.getEvents()`)
 * `phone.css` adds some base styles to style the phone.
 * `fragment.js` turns a html string into a dom node.
